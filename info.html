    <h1>Information</h1>
    <div class="info-content" id="who">
        <h2>Who I am</h2>
        <b>A short introduction</b>
        <p>My name is Thomas. I'm 18 years old and I study Software Development at ROC Midden Nederland.</p>
        <b>Where I'm based</b>
        <p>I'm from the Netherlands — born in Utrecht and raised there until around age seven or eight, when my mother and I moved to a small town in the countryside where we still live.</p>
        <b>Why software development?</b>
        <p>I enjoy working with computers. I spend a lot of my free time on my PC — playing games and experimenting with mods — and that led me to programming. After high school I briefly started learning to become a car mechanic, but after about 1.5 years I decided it wasn't for me and switched to software development. Since then I've been learning web technologies like HTML, CSS, PHP and SQL, and I have been enjoying the learning process.</p>

    <div class="info-content" id="journey">
        <h2>My journey into tech</h2>
        <b>How it began</b>
        <p>I've always been interested in electronics and computers. My first gaming experiences were on a Wii, later I used an older Windows 7 laptop to experiment with modding. At 16 I bought a second-hand PC and upgraded it over time, that experience deepened my interest in modding and coding.</p>
        <b>What keeps me motivated</b>
        <p>Seeing my progress as i work keeps me motivated: when I build a website and refresh to see changes, that immediate feedback is satisfying. I also enjoy problem solving, debugging and finding solutions is rewarding, and the idea of doing work I enjoy motivates me.</p>

    <div class="info-content" id="skills">
        <h2>Skills and interests</h2>
        <b>Technologies I enjoy</b>
        <p>I find web development with HTML, CSS and PHP especially interesting. Turning a plain white and black page into something interactive and visually appealing feels powerful. CSS in particular lets you give a site character and life.</p>
        <b>Preferences</b>
        <p>I personally prefer frontend work, I enjoy building the visual side with HTML and CSS more than backend tasks, although I find backend topics like PHP and SQL interesting as well. In the future I'd like to explore game development and desktop apps.</p>
        <b>Hobbies</b>
        <p>Outside of coding I'm fascinated by military technology and aviation, especially military aircraft. I also enjoy playing video games, some of my favourites include Forza Horizon, GTA V and Red Dead Redemption 2.</p>

    <div class="info-content" id="goals">
        <h2>Goals</h2>
        <b>Short term</b>
        <p>In the short term I want to finish my education and obtain my diploma. After that I'd like to work in web development and continue improving my skills, including learning JavaScript and C.</p>
        <b>Longer term / dream projects</b>
        <p>I have a few dream projects: one is a platform for developers to share projects and get feedback (something this site could evolve into). I'd also like to build a game or a mobile app one day.</p>
